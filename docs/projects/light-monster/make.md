Let's build the Light Monster for your @boardname@!

## Duration: ~1 hour 

## Step 1: Callibrating the servo motor (position)

Depending on the starting position, you'll want to set up the servo horn so that it lies parallel to where the wires connect to the motor.

After this step, you'll be temporarily disconnecting the servo motor from the board. By setting up the callibration in the beginning, you won't have to worry about the positioning of the motor when you connect the motor to the head to create the jaw movement.

## Step 2: Preparing the body

## Step 3: Preparing the head

After cutting out the head, you can work to cut teeth for the monster's jaw!

The second video will walk through how to cut the jaw to the correct shape.

Don't forget about the teeth in the jaw!

## Step 6: Attaching the pipe cleaner to the servo motor

## Step 7: Connecting the servo motor to the head 

If hot glue works better for attaching the servo motor to the top of the head, feel free to use it! In this video I used duct tape, which works just as well as hot glue.

When attaching the pipe cleaner to the bottom of the jaw, make sure you mold it so that the jaw stays closed.

## Step 9: Connecting the servo motor to @boardname@

**Be sure that as you're connecting the servo motor to the crocodile clips and @boardname@, you keep track of the following things:** 
    * The GND crocodile clip should always be wired to the brown wire in the servo. 
    * Make sure that your clips are in the right place - since you coded your circuit playground to recognize signal to and from pin A2, attach the last crocodile clip to A2. 

## Step 10: Attaching the @boardname@ to the monster

Use tape if needed to secure any extra wiring from the crocodile clips to the servo motor. 

**Good work! Now your project is complete and ready to be shown off. Have fun playing with your newly made monster!**
